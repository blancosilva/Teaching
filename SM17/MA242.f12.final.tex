\begin{itemize}
\item Write your name and the last 4 digits of your SSN in the space provided above.
\item The test has five (5) pages, including this one and the table of
  Laplace transforms at the end.  You may use the back of that page as scratch
paper if you need it.
\item The exam is 150 minutes long (2h 30min)
\item Show sufficient work to justify all answers unless otherwise
  stated in the problem.  Correct answers with inconsistent work may
  not be given credit. 
\item Credit for each problem is given at the right of each problem
  number. 
\item No books, notes or calculators may be used on this test.
