\item Write your name and the last 4 digits of your SSN in the space provided above.
\item The test has four (4) pages, including this one.
\item You have fifty (50) minutes to complete the exam.
\item \textbf{There are four problems in page~2: two are on \emph{related rates}, and two on \emph{optimization} (not necessarily in that order!).  Chose one of each: do the problem on related rates on page~3, and the problem on optimization of page~4.}
\item You must show sufficient work to justify all answers unless
  otherwise stated in the problem.  Correct answers with inconsistent
  work may not be given credit.
\item Credit for each problem is given in parentheses at the right of
  the problem number.
\item No books, or notes may be used on this test.  Calculators are ok.

{\problem[50 pts] \em\large A farmer wants to fence an area of 13.5 million square feet in a rectangular field and then divide it in half with a fence parallel to one of the sides of the rectangle. What should the lengths of the sides of the rectangular field be so as to minimize the cost of the fence?}

{\problem[50 pts] \em\large A street light is mounted at the top of a 15-ft-tall pole.  A man $6~\text{ft}$ tall walks away from the pole with a speed of $7~\text{ft}/\text{s}$ along a straight path.  How fast is the tip of his shadow moving when he is $30~\text{ft}$ from the pole? (leave the answer as a fraction)}
