{\problem[5pts] The time rate of change of an alligator population $P$ in a

alligators in the swamp?  What happens thereafter?}
{\problem[10pts] Suppose that the fish population $P(t)$ in a lake is attacked
by a disease at time $t=0$, with the result that the fish cease to reproduce
and the death rate is thereafter proportional to $1/\sqrt{P}$.  If there were
initially 900 fish in the lake, and 441 were left after 6 weeks, how long did
it take all the fish in the lake to die?}
{\problem[10pts] Consider an animal population $P(t)$ with constant death rate

\noindent{\Large Part IV.} If you have received credit from your research
project, work only as many problems as you need to reach the 25 point threshold
(e.g. \textit{if you received 20 credit points, you only need to work a 5-point
problem in this part}).  Otherwise, choose exactly three (3) problems from the
list below that add up to 25 points.   Do each problem on a different half
page.


{\problem[5pts] A body of mass $m=0.5\, kg$ is attached to the end of a spring
that is stretched $2\, m$ by a force of $100\, N$.  It is set in motion with
initial position $x_0=1\, m$ and initial velocity $v_0=-5\, m/s$.  Find the
position of the body as well as the amplitude, frequency, period of oscillation
and time lag of its motion.}
{\problem[5pts] Interpret the following system as describing the interaction of two species with populations $x$ abd $y$.  Draw a slope field, and find the critical points.}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases} x' &= x(1.5-x-0.5y) \\ y' &= y(2-y-0.75x) \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
{\problem[5pts] A spherical tank of radius $4\, ft$ is full of gasoline when a circular bottom hole with radius $1\, in.$ is opened.  How long will be required for all the gasoline to drain from the tank?}
{\problem[10pts]\label{p:tanks} Consider two brine tanks connected as shown below.  Tank 1
contains $x(t)$ pounds of salt in $100\, gal$ of brine and tank 2 contains
$y(t)$ pounds of salt in $200\, gal$ of brine.  The brine in each tank is kept
uniform by stirring, and brine is pumped from each tank to the other at the
rates indicated.  In addition, fresh water flows into tank 1 at $20\, gal/min$,
and the brine in tank 2 flows out at $20\, gal/min$ (so the total volume of
brine in the two tanks remain constant).  The salt concentrations in the two
tanks are $x/100$ pounds per gallon, and $y/200$ pounds per gallon,
respectively.  Find a system of differential equations that model the rates of
change of the amount of salt in the two tanks, and solve it.}
{\problem[10pts]\label{p:circuit} For the circuit below, suppose that $L= 5\, H$, $R = 25\, \Omega$, and the source $E$ of emf is a battery supplying $100\, V$ to the circuit.  Suppose also that the switch has been in position 1 for a long time, so that a steady current of $4 A$ is flowing in the circuit.  At time $t=0$ the switch is thrown to position 2, so that $I(0)=4$ and $E=0$ for $t \geq 0$.  Find $I(t)$.}
